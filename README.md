## About the Game

**Gorillas** is a retro-style artillery game where two gorillas take turns hurling explosive bananas at each other across a cityscape. Players must adjust their angle and velocity to hit their opponent, taking into account environmental conditions like wind.

This version faithfully recreates the original experience from the DOS-era **gorillas.bas** game that came bundled with QBasic, but brings it to the modern web browser.
